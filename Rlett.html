            When I thought of writing something to you , the very first thing I got in my mind is chicken biryani..
            <br>
            You’re such a simple and easygoing person, and that’s something I really admire about you. You never complain about anything, and you just go with the flow. It’s such a wonderful quality you have. And, of course, your love for biryani always makes me smile! We should definitely plan a biryani day soon.
            <br>
            I know you have your mood swings, but that’s just part of who you are, and it’s okay. You’re such a good friend and companion, You may not get too attached to people, but you still care deeply, and that means a lot.
            <br>
            Try avoiding junk a little bit for your health and be cautious of your health. I wish you get all happiness and success in life . 
            <br>
            I guess you have never hurt by my words , if  I did so I’m truly sorry 
            <br>
            We ‘ll meet soon in the office..
